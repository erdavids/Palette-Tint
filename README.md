A small tool that can be used to 'tint' color palettes and export the new colors. It was originally created to avoid manually tinting colors in an illustration tool.

To use, just download the code and run the index.html file.

Features:
- Add palette input, see overlay on multiple palettes all at once, should work with any list of hex codes that are comma separated (ex. "#50514f","#f25f5c","#ffe066","#247ba0","#70c1b3")
- Remove an index from the list or clear all palettes
- Output original colors and edited colors to the console (Copies list to clipboard as well to paste elsewhere)  
- Save an image of the current color palettes
