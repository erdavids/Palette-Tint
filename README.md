# Reds, Blues, and Greens, oh my!

A small tool that can be used to 'tint' color palettes to help add some cohesiveness. Created to avoid manually tinting colors in an illustration tool.

Most likely full of issues because it was developed for a specific use case.

To use, just download the code and run the index.html file.

Features:
- Add palette input, see overlay on multiple palettes all at once, should work with list of hex codes that are comma separated
- Remove any specific index from the list
- Output original colors and edited colors to the console (Adds list to clipboard as well to paste elsewhere)  
- Save an image of the current color palettes
